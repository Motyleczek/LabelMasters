# LabelMasters --> Data

All data used in the project that can be made  public  and is not too big will be stored here. 

Additionally any data generation methods will be stored here, as simple data gathering will not be sufficient.

label_generator.py is the final script used for the generation

Both _sandbox files were used as per experiments and development

- generate_prep has all files necessary to run the generator
- generated_labels has example of the generated results
- photos_of_generated has example of a printed out and photographed label
